            <h5>Four (4) Key Skills</h5>
            <h5>September 8, 2019</h5>

            <p class="blog-body">Throughout my 4+ years of project management and professional consulting experience, I have developed various skills that are not often taught in post-secondary education.  Below, I will share with you <strong>four (4)</strong> skills and what I consider to be important about each one.</p>
            <p><strong>1) Management (People, Products and Services):</strong></p>
            <div class="blog-post">
              <p>Management is not telling someone how to do their job. It is providing the structure for success. A great manager is a communicator that puts all the pieces together by getting feedback from other people and data sources. </p>
              <p>From my experience, I managed projects with multiple parties involved including clients, contractors, property managers, lawyers, real estate agents, lending institutions, fellow engineers and field staff. As a project manager, it was my responsibility to provide project structure and be the center of communication between all the parties involved. I would often relay information between clients and contractors including scheduling conflicts, site/property accessibility and health and safety requirements. In addition to managing specific projects, I managed our team’s product, which was providing professional consulting services to various property representatives across Canada. </p>
              <p>A good manager has research skills and the ability to analyze metrics (which is discussed further below). With regards to managing the product, it was important for me to analyze the market and understand client requirements. Before agreeing to undertake a project for a client, I would first have to ask myself a couple of questions: Have we worked with this client before? If so, was there anything important noted from the previous experience working together? What services, scope and cost can we offer so that the client does not go to one of our competitors? Do we have the current available resources to complete the project within the timeframe specified by the client? These questions help give structure for project execution and help manage the product effectively. </p>

            <p><strong>2) Prioritization (Adjust and Adapt!):</strong></p>
            <div class="blog-post">
              <p>Prioritization also falls under the category of management (discussed above); however, I wanted to include prioritization as its own section here because this is something I struggled with when I first entered the industry. Remember that you are a single individual and there are only so many hours in a day. If you are like me, you strive for perfection and guess what? Nobody is perfect. You’ll want to complete all the tasks on your plate; however, as you progress throughout your career and take on more responsibility, this is simply just not possible. You need to learn to prioritize. </p>
              <p>From my experience, I was managing multiple ongoing projects at once. I set up the structure for project execution; however, it was rare for projects to go exactly according to plan. Due to unexpected occurrences (client requests to change scope or schedule, contractor equipment malfunctions, weather delays, etc.) I had to learn to adapt and adjust. When something unexpected happens during a project, I had to ask myself: What is now the priority?</p>
              <p>If a client requests to change the schedule in one project, the schedule change would need to be communicated to the necessary parties (for example: contractors and field staff would need to be made aware of the client’s requested schedule change to ensure that there are no conflicts) and my attention may need to shift to a separate project which is now the new priority. If a delay occurs in one project and causes the schedule to overlap with another ongoing project, I would need to ask myself: Which project is the priority? It’s important to remember, as I stated above, that you are a single individual and there is only so much you can do a given day. Metrics are a great way to assess priority (discussed further below). I would also ask myself some questions such as: Which option provides the largest risk? Is this a current priority and how will it affect the long-term? Which tasks do I need to handle myself, and what is something that I can maybe hand off to someone else? Is this a discussion that I need to have with my team or my Director? If you are fortunate enough to have amazing team members (like I did), they will often be able to provide support in situations where conflicts occur. Set priorities, ensure the necessary parties are made aware of any changes in schedule or scope, and keep detailed records.</p>

            <p><strong>3) Research, Data Analysis and Metrics:</strong></p>
            <div class="blog-post">
              <p>You may have noticed a theme in my first two points. I ask a lot of questions. Conducting research is very important prior to undertaking a task or project. To conduct proper research, you need to ask questions. I won’t go into the details of all the research I completed prior to initiating my projects, but it is important to understand that thorough research, which may be time consuming at first, can save you a lot of headache in the future. I know you may be excited to jump right into a project, but good background research will help you devise an efficient plan and reduce backlog in the future. </p>
              <p>Metrics are also very important to analyze. It’s important to understand how your team or product is performing and where improvements can be made. You also need to ensure that you are obtaining metrics from reliable sources. For me, obtaining a metric from a single project is not very useful; however, obtaining that same metric over multiple projects over a specified period of time can provide some useful information. </p>
              <p>Say you have a good set of project data to analyze. You analyze the data and see that the time spent on project reporting is inconsistent and causes multiple projects to exceed the proposed budget. That is your team is spending about 25% more time on reporting than what is budgeted on a typical project. You then discuss with your team to come up with possible solutions. Do you start increasing your project budget moving forward to account for the extra reporting time? Do you start asking your clients for extra money if the reporting time exceeds what was budgeted? Do you write shorter reports? </p>
              <p>Metrics and data analysis not only help you find problems, but they can also help you find solutions! What is the current customer satisfaction rate? If we increase the proposed budget to account for this extra time, will our clients start going to our competitors? By how much percent can we increase our budgets as to not lead our clients to our competitors? What is our cost compared to our competitors? Will we take on any additional liability if we choose to cut out certain sections of the report to make it shorter? These are all questions you need to consider before making a decision. I won’t give all the exact metrics here, but a solution we came up with was to make the report template shorter by replacing certain sections of the report with tables (which previously contained multiple paragraphs). This way, we were not increasing the price of our product and still maintained the quality of our product. This decision was made after going through each of the possible solutions and analyzing all available metrics.

            <p><strong>4) Communication and Follow-Up Emails:</strong></p>
            <div class="blog-post">
              <p>You’ve heard of it before, communication is key. Communication is anything from giving a presentation to writing an email. It is important to know your audience and understand what information your audience needs to receive. </p>
              <p>With regards to my experience, it is important that clients, contractors and team members understand the scope of the work being undertaken. When giving a presentation or discussing project details over the phone, be clear, but also be concise. Chances are, your audience will not remember every detail of your presentation. This is why I always followed up presentations and important phone calls with emails. The follow up email should summarize what was discussed and should provide any additional context such as links and data. At the same time, don’t overthink the summary email. Yes, it needs to be clear, but again, remember who your audience is. For example, the client does not need to know about the drill rig model number; however, my field staff and the contractors may want to know this information. My clients would likely be more concerned about details regarding cost and schedule. Understand the details required by your audience and allow your audience to provide feedback and ask questions.</p>
